  Abstract                 = {The paper describes three approaches for solving the problem of estimation of systematic errors in radar measurements obtained from several overlapping observation domains. In the proposed approaches, neither one of the radars could be considered as a reference one. The systematic errors are determined by the processing of measurements of the radars due to informational redundancy in the radar data. The proposed methods can be used in computational information complexes of the air traffic control systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Bias estimation or sensor registration is an essential step in ensuring the accuracy of global tracks in multisensor-multitarget tracking. Most algorithms previously proposed for bias estimation rely on local measurements in centralized systems or tracks in distributed systems, along with additional information like covariances, filter gains or targets of opportunity. In addition, it is generally assumed that such data are made available to the fusion center at every sampling time. In real distributed multisensor tracking systems, where each platform sends locals tracks to the fusion center, only state estimates and, perhaps, their covariances are sent to the fusion center at non-consecutive sampling instants or scans. That is, not all the information required for exact bias estimation, at the fusion center is available in practical distributed tracking systems. In this paper, a new algorithm that is capable of accurate bias estimation even in the absence of filter gain information from local platforms, is proposed for distributed tracking systems with irregular track transmission rates. It is shown that the performance of the new algorithm, which uses the tracklet idea and does not require track transmission at every sampling time or exchange of filter gains, can approach the performance of the exact bias estimation algorithm that requires local filter gains.},
